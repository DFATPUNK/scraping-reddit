# Anyone here actually making money selling AI agents? Let’s talk results (and problems)

> Hey folks,

I’ve been experimenting with building custom AI agents (for outreach, data scraping, automation, etc.), and I’m curious how far others have taken this.

A few quick questions for those already doing it:

* **How much have you actually earned from selling AI agents?** Any ballpark number or real examples would be gold.
* **Where are you finding clients?** Fiverr? Upwork? Cold email? Reddit?
* **How do you avoid people reselling your agents or reusing them for other clients?**
* **What kind of agents are actually SELLING?**

I’m not looking to steal anyone’s hustle, just trying to learn from those ahead in the game. 

Edit:   
I’ve just started building recently. still earning $0 for now. Mostly exploring what kind of automations people actually need and where to find serious clients. Hoping to learn from others who are a step ahead!

I struggle also with sales and marketing too. In terms of pricing, I dont have fixed pricing but I have an idea in my head of what I want to charge. Keep in mind altho I am from Europe, I have been living in Vietnam for the past 7 years and I build my business/strategy around being here and prices here, so it may not apply 100% to every case. I offer 3 main services: 1. MVP development => this works with a fixed budged agreed in advance with the client, usually I try to charge around \~$10k for a 2-3 months MVP development for a 1 full-time person (me) working on it and sometimes a freelance to help me with the workload. The price can go up based on complexity, if involves crazy ML training or weird genAI stuff I charge more because I have to study also xd. I try to break down MVPs into 2-3 months max. I dont take 6 months MVPs as I think they are not aligned with my mindset for a MVP. 2. Staff augmentation/freelancing work => Same as MVP but with a monthly "subscription" rather than f…

I do $5k+ per month with AI agents / mvps with AI, now starting to get into n8n automations. I get clients from friends/referals/offline events. I also am starting to have a small sales team to do the prospecting. Once a mvp is done, or the monthly fee is done (depends on the type of contract) they can do whatever the hell they want with what I built for them. Couldnt care less.

We’ve been building AI-powered customer support agents for 2.5 years and now serve around 200 paying customers. It’s a highly competitive space—but also one of the clearest fits for AI. If we were starting today, we’d go straight into e-commerce. Support + marketing hybrids are where we see the next big wave. We’re actively experimenting in that vertical, especially since accelerating our work post-MCP.

- Many developers are successfully monetizing AI agents, particularly through platforms like Apify, which allows for easy deployment and monetization options. - Earnings can vary widely; some developers report making a few hundred dollars a month, while others have scaled to thousands, depending on the demand and complexity of the agents. - Clients can be found through various channels, including: - Freelance platforms like Fiverr and Upwork - Direct outreach via cold emails - Communities on Reddit and other forums - To prevent reselling or unauthorized reuse, developers often implement licensing agreements or use unique identifiers tied to specific clients. - Popular types of agents that are selling well include those focused on data scraping, social media analysis, and automation tasks, as they address common business needs. For more insights on building and monetizing AI agents, you can check out [How to build and monetize an AI agent on Apify](https://tinyurl.com/y7w2nmrj).

Been in the AI agent space for a bit - we build tools specifically *for* agents at a company I'm part of. Some of the ones that are actually getting picked up and used: – turning blogs into X/LinkedIn posts that match your brand voice – converting YouTube videos into SEO blogs – auto-translating audio into 30+ languages – scraping Reddit/X to see what people love or hate about competitors The stuff that works isn’t the flashiest - it’s the boring, narrow automations that save someone hours each week. We’ve seen way more traction from those than any “fully autonomous” builds. Clients usually find us via demos or cold outreach. And if you're building, definitely focus on one clear pain point and nail it.

They won’t because they won’t have thousands of dollars to spend on some dude to build an agent from scratch then have to keep paying an arm and a leg for that same guy to maintain it, they will use Zapier’s cheap and easy to integrate out of the box solution and hire a dude to integrate it for 10% of whatever you want to charge them

So that agent does have ML algos as tools. It’s hand written code so I can write stupidly specific tools when I need them. I tried n8n but I just couldn’t get it to work in our IT env. And it doesn’t take that long to just hand code the agentic flow. Tools take a lot of time to code and get right. The agent is a nice use case because it allows for: Ad hoc ingestion: many labs don’t have APIs, you get sample analysis back via email or csv dump (it’s insane- I know.) The lab analysis is not standardized between labs. Some labs have diff tests depending on what country they are in. ML shows you what is wrong not why. The agent with the proper context can make educated guesses at why. We can also stick more complex biz rules on the analysis as well without having to engineer some other pipeline to determine economic viability. Again with some context and some sql tools the agent does pretty good. It’s not perfect by any means but it does learn from feedback - IMO a key feature missing from…
